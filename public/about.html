<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a motivated and detail-oriented engineering student with a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals, digital electronics, and discrete mathematics. I enjoy breaking down complex concepts into clear, logical structures and approach problem-solving with precision and discipline. My academic journey has helped me develop analytical thinking and a solid grasp of core technical principles.</p>

<p>I have a growing focus on Java programming and object-oriented concepts, with hands-on experience in topics such as OOPs, exception handling, arrays, inheritance, and abstraction. I value clean logic, correctness, and clarity in code, and I consistently work on strengthening my understanding through practice, debugging, and concept-driven learning rather than shortcuts.</p>

<p>Beyond technical skills, I am consistent, self-driven, and improvement-oriented. I actively seek depth over surface-level knowledge and aim to build a strong conceptual base that will support long-term growth in software development and engineering roles. I am committed to continuous learning and to transforming theoretical knowledge into practical, real-world solutions.</p>
